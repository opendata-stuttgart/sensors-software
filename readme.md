# Software for Sensor.Community / Luftdaten.Info Sensor

## airrohr-firmware

The maintained main firmware for the Sensor.Community / Luftdaten.Info Sensor. 

## airrohr-update-loader

A transitional firmware which will look for a firmware file
stored on SPIFFS to replace itself with for next reboot
or do an endless loop of panic LED blinking if this fails.

This allows to do an Over-the-air (OTA) procedure on setups
that have a 1M/3M split layout (rather the more modern 2M/2M)
for firmwares larger than 512k (up to ~ 740k).
